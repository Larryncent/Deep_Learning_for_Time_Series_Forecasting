## Deep_Learning_for_Time_Series_Forecasting
[Data windowing]: Create a Data Windowing algorithm capable of efficiently determining:
- The width (number of time steps) of the input and label windows
- The time offset between them.
so as to enhance computational performance.
[ Multi-Step Models ]: predicting all the features across all output time steps.
Based on the Data Windowing algorithm established, determine:
- The width (number of time steps) of the input and label windows
- The time offset between them.
Compare the performance of the following algorithms based on the R^2 score:
- DNN
- CNN
- RNN.
